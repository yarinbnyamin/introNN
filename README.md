# Interdiction to neural networks
This project will show you how neural networks and how to smartly use them

# First part ([taken from here](https://github.com/rasbt/machine-learning-book/blob/main/ch11/ch11.ipynb)) 
Will show you how neural networks work - see warm_up.ipynb [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yarinbnyamin/introNN/blob/main/warm_up.ipynb)


# Second part ([that use the data from here](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/)) 
Will show you how to solve new problems using a pre-trained network (for faster start-up) - see transfer_learning.ipynb [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yarinbnyamin/introNN/blob/main/transfer_learning.ipynb)
